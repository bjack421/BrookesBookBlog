    <h1> Welcome! </h1>

<h3> I am thrilled to be starting my own book blog!</h3> 

In 3rd grade, I moved to a new town and did not have any friends to spend my summer with. I picked up a chapter
book called P.S. Longer Letter Later. This book was about a young girl who had moved away from her best friend and they
were trying to navigate long distance friendship. This resonated with me in a way that I did not know books could. This
was the beginning of a lifelong love of reading. This led me to a career as a high school English teacher in Lexington, KY. In addition to my love of reading, I have a beautiful family. I have two little girls, Ellery (4) and Halle (10 months).
They have introduced me to a love of children's literature as well.

<br>
<h4>I hope that my recent adventures in reading can help you find your own next great read!</h4>

My focus for the book reviews on this site will be mystery and thriller, romance, and young adult. 

In addition to my ever growing list of titles in each of these genres, each month I will highlight a book I am currently reading and pair it with another love of mine- traveling! I will plan a trip based on the book's setting and journey of the protagonist! This will give me a chance to highlight some fun choices outside of my top 3 genres! Check out these picks at Reading: A Journey! <br>
