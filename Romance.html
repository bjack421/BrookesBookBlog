    <td>If you are looking for a beach read, this is it! A fun enemies to lovers trope. A brooding young writer and a woman looking to make a new start, who doesn't love it? There is some slight steam but it is balanced with sweet and funny moments. Light and easy!</td>
    <td>The best book I have read in my adult life! This is my go to recommendation! Taylor Jenkins Reid creates a world with so many layers, it feels real. Evelyn is flawed, beautiful, and so human. BookTok has played up the "twist ending". I do not think there is a twist ending. Don't read this book as a thriller. Read it as an experience!</td>
    <td>    <b><u>HOT TAKE:</u></b>this book was not my style AT ALL. Far too much sexual violence. I know it is popular, but I do not get the hype. I was very uncomfortable and I didn't think either romance was worth the time I invested.</td>

    <td>This book is too much fun. The style was perfect for the content. The use of blogs, social media posts, and narrative reflected what the experience for the first plus sized Bachelorette would be. Man do you root for her! This is a <b><u>GREAT</u></b> audiobook and I am very picky about audiobooks!</td>
    <td>I didn't think I liked super steamy books until I read this one! I would <b><u>NOT</u></b> listen to this as an audiobook. You will be embarrassed if you are anything like me. Despite its steam, it is sweet and adds some depth to the humans involved in the porn industry. Lovable characters and it opened up my mind!</td>
    <td>This book lives up to the online hype! Everyone I have talked to loves it! It feels like an adult YA book. It is an easy read with young adult characters who you love to root for. It is relevant and funny- plus who doesn't love a love story with a prince?</td>
